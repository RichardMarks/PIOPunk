PIOPunk
version 1.0
Using Player.IO with FlashPunk
Example Game by Richard Marks


I've made this example both to learn how to use Player.IO and to help others.
You're free to use this code as a starting point for your own games.

Notes: 

I am using my modified FlashPunk 1.4 available here:

https://github.com/RichardMarks/FlashPunk1.4mod

And Player.IO Development Package version 2.0 from http://playerio.com

Feel free to email me if you have questions.
